"ideal" column isn't like... that ideal. it's just one route to have enough for splashless at the end. Here's the bomb route I'm personally considering for trying to get splashless (and have safety along the way)

# Fox's intended pickups

All of the obvious ones (saha, the almost-free ones in pod, etc)

PoD falldown, 2-bomb hammeryump, and 2 extra middle room bombs, with the intention of leaving PoD with 9 bombs (the max). This is maximum safety going into overworld conveyor, and makes it very likely to have enough for fake flippers later. The alternative is to get more bombs in TT which aren't faster, to skip fake flippers which is slower, or to gamble 50/50s, as far as I can tell.

If there's no conveyor disaster, I should have 7 going to the uncle cave. With a conveyor disaster I will have 5, which is great, or 3 with 2 disasters, which is actually still fine.

With no wasted bombs, this leaves me with 4 entering TT, which would allow me to pick up only the chest in the attic. The aim is to leave with 7 if possible (5 is always possible). Leaving with 6 gives 2 chances at a 50/50 to do splashless. Leaving with 5 would require winning both 50/50s, which is a 1/8 chance to save 7 seconds at the cost of 2 seconds, which isn't worth it, so just deal with it at that point (or get fast at bombless ice clip).

# Checkpoints

5 leaving PoD is effectively mandatory. it's also not hard to manage. 7 leaving PoD gives you a lot of extra leeway wrt overworld conveyor mishaps (and the rest of the run, of course). After hammer, you'll leave with however many bombs you have if you get both almost-free ones along the way (middle room + right room after statue drag), so plan accordingly. Not much can really go wrong but you can grab extra bombs on trips through various pod rooms if you want safeties. 


4 leaving thieves is enough to finish the game if you're willing to forego the ice bomb clip. 5 is enough if you're not (the "necessary" route assumes you are not willing to forego the bomb clip). 6 will let you skip fake flippers. 7 will let you use a bomb in bombable floor. Refilling to 5 is pointless (unless you're really hoping for a 50/50 on the way to Ice).

Summary being: 4 or 6 leaving thieves.



# Footnotes

\* both pots costs ~2s. chest costs ~3s. Both costs ~5s. Entering with 0 and picking up all 5 only costs about 5.5s because you're never waiting on the bomb timer anyway.

if getting chest: get chest first, place bomb immediately after, throw and dash out
if getting pots: place bomb late, get both pots, dashing left and walking out or walking up and dashing out are basically tied afaict
if getting both: chest first, then do the pots strat

\*\* Technically, you could get to the IR overworld, and then enter and leave one of the open caves to fix the camera somewhat, and then do a teleport in. this will be both slow and painful because you won't have normal cues, but it's technically possible. I would never recommend it.
