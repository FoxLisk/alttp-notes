1. get to hyrule castle
1. quadrant glitch
   * clink left torch
   * stand on Y-XFF
   * wait for the guard to tink you and release
   * technically i think you just have to release while you're moving from XFF to X00, if you have a good enough cue for that it should be fine

1. transition left and down. you'll wrap around if you got the quadrant glitch
1. hold <^ after the wonky transition, then walk ^ and pump < until you transition north
   * Stop pumping no farther left than when 2 diagonal blue tiles of floor are visible on the left
1. walk ^ and pump < until a mini-transition,
   * same stop point left here
1. Walk < until you transition (4 thrones)
1. Walk ^ and pump > a very small amount until you transition (watch magic meter vs. the trim on the floor)

# Transition to ice tileset
1. hold ^ here. the camera will lock and then unlock. After it unlocks, switch to v
   * it's about 3 beats of the music from locking to unlocking again to try to time it
1. Walk v until your magic bar lines up with the wall in a particular way
   * the camera will be locked for the beginning of this and then unlock.
   * there are 5 pixels that work
   * the range of pixels is D62-D66
1. walk > to the transition
1. tap v, then walk up a step and left to hop into the void and re-arm EG
   * this will snap you to Y-D60
1. tap ^ and snap to Y-D68
1. tap < and snap to X-F10
1. roll from < to <v back to < and transition left
1. hold ^ until the chair disappears off the bottom of the screen then <^
1. after you transition inside the well, hold > and then leave the well

# inside the well
1. jump in the well
1. get bombs
1. throw bomb so that you can stand above it in the top left corner
1. Get knocked into EG while holding <
1. hold <
1. You'll reach a room with the ice tileset that has a bunch of + shaped rooms. The screen will shift a little and then start scrolling normally. Once it begins scrolling normally, hold <^
1. Once you transition (brown tiles again), hold <^ until the bottom of the wall is at the bottom of the screen (you can go a little high)
   * the vertical range that works here is extremely large. you're too low if you hop instead of transitioning upwards to the mimics room.
1. move down a little bit (a few pumps or a brief tap)
   * this corrects the camera...? if you don't do it you end up in the wrong quadrant of the tall room, or something
1. when the magic bar passes the pots, switch to <^ again
1. this will transition you to pod mimics. make sure to leave thru the door. You should be able to just hold v
1. go down the stairs, get hearts and bombs and hit the switch and leave left

DO NOT KILL MINI HELMA

1. get lots of bombs

1. hold A+^ thru transition
1. pull statue partly into the stairs and wait for antifairy hit
1. start holding ^ again during antifairy hit
1. NOW kill the mini helma
   * If you don't get a heart you have to reset LMAO
1  You have to get out the door without entering the statue push animation now
   * if you walk down and then hold <v and never press < while you're against the statue, that works
   * if you're afraid of this you can face right or down and hold sword out to push the statue without grabbing it, until you're past it.
1. Do the [statue drag to Helma](./all%20bosses%20no%20eg/glitches.md#statue-drag)
