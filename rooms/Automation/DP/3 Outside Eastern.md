Not really automatible except for minor things.

Hold ^ during the first dash up, and cancel holding <^ to automatically slide along the wall to the stairs.

On the bottom half kf the screen, you can hold <v to cut diagonally between the statues. Once past the left statue, switch to v> to align on the statue's side
