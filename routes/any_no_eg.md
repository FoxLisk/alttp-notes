Hookpush to Triforce:

misslot a hook:
  * dodge trident
  * stand around 1/3 down from the top of the room facing a wall
  * 3 arrows in wall
  * face torch, hold sword out, 2 bombs OR bomb + boomerang
  * hook
  * RELEASE SWORD
  * hook again

this makes it so that the first hook gets misslotted (it eats a sparkle instead of an arrow), and *the second hook gets slotted correctly* into 0-4. specifically it will replace an arrow and be in slots 2-4.

now throw the boom east. this means we will read hookpushing data from slot 1. it's important that we don't read hookpushing data from where the hook actually was, because its direction is down which is not helpful

go to the top of the room and place two bombs while facing up, then face left or right.

when they start exploding, lamp twice (direction shouldnt matter ?) and then MASH hook out of the menu

if all goes well, the 0-4 slots will be filled with [bomb explosion, bomb explosion, lamp, lamp, hook]. the lamps and hook might be in a different order, it shouldn't matter. these ancilla are all too stronk for the hookshot; it will fail to spawn, and we will read data from slot 1 (as set by the boomerang), which should by this point be 0B from the bomb explosion with direction set to north.


** is it possible to place the bombs facing up, then turn down, slash, hook, drop slash and re-hook? do we get sparkles in time?
