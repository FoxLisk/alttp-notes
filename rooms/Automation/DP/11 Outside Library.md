Unholy Spinspeed:

Two parts can be automated: once you reach the long horizontal section of cliff after activing spinspeed, you can hold <^ until you are aligned with the stairs; and off the stairs you can hold up until you touch the wall and then switch to ^> to enter the door cleanly.

Dashing:
Buffer < and dash left.
Stop the dash and move ^ through the gap, then < under the fence.
Move ^ slightly between the wall and the fence and dash up to the stairs.
Once on the stairs, hold ^> until you align with the door, then hold ^.
