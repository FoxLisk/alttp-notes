# Should you get Sanctuary Heart?

## Analysis

Well, what do we have it for? You can pick it up after finishing Escape (you could pick it up at the beginning of escape for a small time cost but escape with your gear is very easy already). What breakpoints does it give us?

For the shopping & thieves' town sections, it won't help us, because you spawn with 4 hearts with or without it, and there's s&qs before you'd take any damage.

For Skull it would get you to 7 hearts. If all goes normally, you take 1 damage from a bomb jump in Skull, so Sanc would get you from 5 to 6 hearts, which isn't super useful because everything does 2 damage. It's a consideration but low value, especially because we get to skip all of the dangerous rooms (except Moth)

For TR it would get you from 8 hearts to 9. You don't have to do anything in TR except kill Agah2, though, so this seems pretty unnecessary. You also take 1 bomb damage, so you'd have to pick up a heart to be able to take an extra hit from Trinexx. Very minor consideration, only if you struggle with Trinexx.

For Mire it would get you from 9 to 10. You don't do much of anything scary in Mire except Vitty, so this seems low value as well.

Desert is already super trivial.

Arrghus you'd have 12 hearts instead of 11. You don't get the Desert refill going in, but you also don't have to do anything except bait Arghus and take a bomb hit. Low value

Ice you'd have 13 instead of 12, which means you'd spawn with... 7 hearts instead of 7. So it has 0 value here.

If you need 14 hearts to fight Agah 1 something has gone very wrong.

You get a refill before Ganon, so the 14th heart doesn't help there either, since everything does even amounts of damage.

## Conclusion

Sanc heart is very low value. If you're struggling with one of the places where you get to have full hearts, go for it, but otherwise it's not worth it even though it's very fast. Skull is the most likely place for it to be relevant.
