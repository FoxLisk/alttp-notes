AD route thru kiki skip/pod reload

# PoD:

  * Go directly to the bridge and deathhole\* to get to the big key. grab bombs/arrows
  * Go hammeryump.
  * Statue Drag\*
  * Kill Helma

# Escape:

  * Save & Quit (you are put automatically into sanc)
  * river clip, etc, etc, you know the drill 

# Thieves (/Collection):

  * Save & Quit to old man
  * Hera clip
  * Walk far enough into the room that you're definitely not in door state
  * Leave again, activate spinspeed high on the stairs (like, 4 steps below you high)
  * if you fuck up spinspeed, just walk to the bridge and dash left
  * Now do overworld conveyor\*
  * In the ow conveyor state, hold up to walk along the slope. this will put you on X-6FF
    * From here, hold your sword out and do 1-frames to the left. If you pop way to the left, back off and start trying again. if you nudge 1 frame right, let yourself get conveyed into lost woods. Hold sword charge here! There are tiles somewhere on the next screen that fuck up your $EF value and put you in EG in mire.
  * This will eventually carry you to something that, at least, *looks* like the ether medallion island again. Make sure your sword is held out no later than now
  * Release the spin on either the 2nd frame Link is on Y-E1A or the first frame he's on Y-E19
    1. E1C is when, between link's shield and the dark shadow, there's 1 pixel of dirt and then 2 pixels of dirt on the right: like a little triangle, long on the right.
    1. Once you get there, you're moving 1px every other frame.
    1. When you move up 1 pixel, you're on E1B. Now the left pixel of dirt is gone, and there's 1 pixel of dirt left in the second column
    1. When you move up 1 pixel, you're on E1A, but you can't spin yet. You have to wait 1 frame; select buffer until you see the sword sparkles change.
    1. You could also wait 2 frames, so if you see Link move 1 pixel all is not necessarily lost
    1. Cancel the final select buffer WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN B

  * Continue being conveyed for another transition.
    * If you're on the wrong layer, you can pause and mirror, which will put you back into the right layer, still in the conveyor state.
    * if you're on the wrong layer and *can't* mirror, you slashed or armed spinspeed too low or dashed through the bad X co-ord outside of Hera. (can this be fixed?)
  * After the screen transition, wait until link's head is just touching the topmost line of rocks (the "bottom-most", vertically; the one closest to the pit) and dash turn down to bonk onto the platform with the chest
    * if you bonk too early you get into EG
    * if you bonk too late you softlock
    * good luck
    * the safe way to do this is to tap < early, tap v to kick into the right pixel, tap < and dashturn again. you can do this too early as well though.
  * open the chest and get the big key (this is cave state big key!)
  * Follow the path for a while (or MIRE BOMB JUMP), go hit the switch in the bari room
  * go to somaria. you can get the arrows from the hub if you like. Now it's time for:

# TRICKS

## Deathhole:

NOTE: If you do something wrong with a bomb, make sure you let it fully finish exploding and be off screen before you place a new bomb to try again. Placing the 2nd bomb while there's one on screen will put it in slot 0 and the deathhole will crash.

 1. be at <= 1 heart
 1. stand on a good Y pixel (6D1/6D2) with your back to the left wall.
 1. bombdash
 1. out of the bonk, hold up
 1. slash once before falling
 1. You will now die and the screen gets fucked. hold v and you'll fall for real and be active on the bottom floor, but the door is deleted.
 1. maybe menu to mirror during the fall since your menu is solid black at this point


## Statue Drag:

 1. go touch the statue in the 2nd room and mirror
    * this puts you in a state where if you hit A you will grab a nonexistent statue. This overrides picking up bombs, in particular
 1. place a bomb high in the door. Chex's setup is to walk to the left a step so when you get to the door you'll nudge into it, thus knowing for sure you're as high up as you wanna be
 1. walk into the door, face down, grab the statue and drag it up
   * when the bomb hits you, it should snap you to Y-910
 1. face left, place a bomb, slash twice for timing, face down, grab the statue, and pull up again
   * when _this_ bomb hits you, it should snap you to Y-900
 1. walk down. if the camera is broken, you've succeeded. if not, mirror and retry.
 1. walk into the big door, face up, drag the statue down. once the pots are fully on screen you can let go of the statue and just walk down.
   * at this point, you're in some weird state but collision is PoD-2, with the centerpiece and the bomb pots.
 1. What you wanna do from here is pick up the right bomb, walk into the right enclosure, grab the heart from the bottom-right pot, then walk up and hit the switch. 
 1. make sure the camera is high enough (Chex uses a cue with the top left item indicator) you'll then dash down through the door, which will put you in what LOOKS like the right wing of PoD-1, but is actually still PoD-2; walk down a step, walk right to hit the switch again, dash down again, and you enter helma's room
 1. in helma's room, walk left into a spike, then hold <^ to get around the spikes. then walk down and kill the spiky boi.


## Overworld Conveyor
 
 (starts ~1:20:40 in Chex's tutorial)

 1. Get yourself lined up against the first / slope in the ether tablet island
 1. Lamp 3 times facing up (or left or down, but NOT RIGHT)
 1. Hold sword out
 1. Shoot 3 arrows
 1. Quickly menu to bombs
 1. Do a "Bomb Dust" (kick up dust and lay 2 bombs)
   * Basically this is tap A and then mash Y. you want to place both bombs while the dust is still on the screen, but you have to let go of A before you can place bombs
   * this feels quite finicky so far
 1. pick up a bomb, throw it, pick up another bomb
 1. after the bomb hits you is when you can release sword

## North Somaria
 (starts ~1:48:00)

 1. Place a somaria block semi inside the door. Do this by abutting the  wall facing north slightly to the left of the left edge of the doorway.
    * or by being a couple pixels away from the wall, which makes the horizontal range wider
 1. Hold Link's sword out to the left and walk into the door.
    * if you can't, the block is too far to the right (probably)
 1. Pick up the block.
 1. Tap v (this snaps you into position)
 1. Tap ^ 
 1. Throw the block
 1. Tap ^ (this jukes the transition)

Now you get rid of the block however and leave the door, i.e. by holding down, throwing the block, and dashing out.

## East Somaria
 (Starts ~1:50:00)

 1. Hold your sword out facing down.
 1. Step into a doorway to align yourself vertically
 1. Step far enough out of the doorway to place a block (not very precise)
 1. Step back into the doorway pretty far and pick it up
 1. Throw it upwards
 1. Walk deeper in the door
 1. Turn back to the left and pick it up
 1. tap to the left again while you're holding it
 1. the block should now be cut roughly in half by the wall 
  * this is visible even on my shitty TV that's missing a billion pixels
  * you should be on X-6E8
 1. now you want to move 2px to the right.
  * Chex recommends: throw block, dash-buffer right twice.
  * I got it first try doing similar: throw block, dash buffer once, repeat
  * you want to land on X-6EA
  * if there's 1 px of white in the middle of the block showing, you're in the right place
  * alternatively, there should be a vertical line of 2 white pixels to the left of the somaria block
 1. tap to the left (this jukes the transition)

 1. throw the block, dash-buffer to the left a couple times. 2 or 3 frames to the left seem fine
 1. tap right (while the block is _on the ground_) and you done baby (this is the 2nd juke)
    
 TODO: this causes massive graphical corruption, is that... bad?

## South Somaria

 (Starts ~2:00:00)
 (demo with link visible at ~2:10:00)

 1. pick up a block, walk into the door (it won't let you; this is just to line up)
 1. throw the block while still holding down so you get into the door
 1. face up and grab the block
 1. throw the block left and move down some more
 1. pick the block up and tap ^ to snap down
   * if done right the doorframe should roughly slice the block in 2
 1. throw the block again and tap v a bit
 1. pick up the block again
   1. if you see sweat droplets during the pickup, ???
   1. if not it's propbably still fine?
 1. tap ^ to snap down
 1. throw the block to the left and pause quickly
   * if the block appears SUPER low on the screen, going left, you're good
   * if not, tap ^, pick up the block, tap ^ to snap down again
 1. once the block is moving to the left from the weird place and you're paused, menu to bombs
 1. place the bomb and select buffer
 1. use the somaria block's movement in the air to select buffer 2 frames downward
  * this gets you to AE3
 1. pick up the bomb
 1. tap ^ (snap to AE8)
 1. Throw the bomb
 1. walk v a bunch (Chex goes as low as B06 which is like over a tile)
 1. hold ^ to transition into thieves town

## Bomb Juke

  (Starts ~2:04:40)

 1. Abut the south wall, nudge into the door a bit to make sure you're placing it pretty deep
 1. place the bomb
 1. walk down into the door pretty far
 1. pick up the bomb
 1. tap ^ to snap down (to AE0)
 1. throw the bomb
    * if link's hat isn't on screen you're fine
 1. place another bomb
 1. do 2 frames south 
    * use the zazak's animation to time this
 1. pick up the bomb, tap ^ to snap, throw the bomb, walk down. you'll come down from the top of the screen.

## West Somaria

  (Starts about 2:23:00)

This is like a combination of North and East somarias. You do a setup more like an East, but then you don't have to do the extra back and forth buffers

 1. Sword out, facing down, place the block outside the door so you can pick it up
 1. Walk into the door, pick up the block
 1. throw it upward
 1. walk farther left, grab it, snap
 1. repeat until you're deep in the wall (with the block not in your hands, only your shield is visible)
 1. tap <
 
## Mire Hookpush
  (Starts about 3:10)

 1. Lamp 3x as setup
 1. hold sword out
 1. 3 arrows
 1. menu to boom, throw it v>
 1. immediately menu to fire rod, shoot up
 1. as soon as the fire rod hits the wall, lay a block
 1. you want 2c in slot 9
 1. walk up into the maze, go into the top right corner, and hook down
 1. kill vitty

## Somaria-Only Hookpush

 1. break the block and slash
 1. turn down and dust-block

 1. walk up above the torch, dash turn down, and dust-hook (you have to kick up dust to get the push)

## Bomb snap

  (starts ~3:29:00)

 1. place a bomb in the door. The one in swamp is an auto door, so i'm holding my sword out, lining up with the non-autodoor part of the wall to the right, and then pulling back to the left
 1. walk a few steps into the door and pick up the bomb
 1. throw the bomb
   1. method A:
     * wait for the bomb to blow up
     * place another bomb (either facing up, then pick up and throw, or just face left)
     * wait for it to flash 2 times, then tap ^ followed quickly by A
   1. method b:
     * pick up the bomb and throw it again and then do the ^ and A without wasting a bomb
 1. you should now be at Y-510
