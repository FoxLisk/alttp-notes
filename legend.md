I've got rooms annotated with shitty MS paint drawings to indicate the general flow of them. Here's an attempt at providing a legend.

sorry this sucks so far

| symbol | meaning | example |
| white line | walk | - |
| green line | dash | - |
| item | place item | - |
| yellow arrow | throw item | - |
| red star | spin | - |
