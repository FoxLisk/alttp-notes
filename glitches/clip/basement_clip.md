This clip can be thought of in three steps:

1. [Getting Superspeed](#getting-superspeed)
2. [Teleport](#teleport)
3. [Rail clip](#rail-clip)

# Getting Superspeed

## With a potion

1. Get all the way into the spiral staircase
   1. You can get hit by an antifairy if there's one around
   2. You can bomb snap
   3. You can just walk to the pixel
2. Spindash
3. YBA (i.e. press press ^+Y on the same frame. Make sure you are actually missing some of the resource the potion refills.)

## With Somaria

1. Place a slot 0 block (place a block, blow it up, place another while the beams are on screen)
2. Spindash
3. Stand next to the block
4. Lamp a couple times and pick up the block
5. Run into the spiral stairs (you can't go up, but you will get superspeed)

# Teleport

How to read these notes:

    all inputs are 1 frames unless otherwise specified: 

    >2 means "2 frames right" 
    v>{1-2} means "1 or 2 frames right"
    <h means "press left, hold it as long as you want" 
    a^ means "dashturn up" 
    

`^ >2 v` - if you only move 1 frame right, you can go v and then v> to get all the way in  
`^> v ^> v`  
`v>h` - this will move you deeper in the wall. if it doesnt you need to redo theprevious two `^> v` motions

`<^ < v>` (this is the teleport)

For most of these steps if you miss a diagonal you can just tap v to get back in the wall and only have to retry one of the steps again. I'm not going to list every single retry point out though, sorry.

# Rail Clip

## Moving down

We repeat a sequence several times that moves link down 1 pixel at the end. We do this to move Link a total of 4 pixels down. But first we have to get into the rail and end superspeed.

```
<h - first we have to get into the rail with superspeed still active  
a  - then we cancel it  
   <v > av v>{1-2} (1)
<h <v > av v>{1-2} (2)  
<h <v > av v>{1-2} (3)  
<h <v > av v>{1-2} (4) - Link should now be on Y-5E  
```

If you get a 2 frame movement on any of the `>`s here, you can slash your sword and move backwards

If you moved 2 frames `v>` on the last step, make sure to walk `<`. You can always walk `<` for safety if you wish.

`>` slash and hold sword  
`<h` - make sure Link is backed up all the way  
`<v{1-2}`  
release sword now  
`a^`  

now place a bomb, hold sword out and move 1f right.
After you get hit, dash left (for as long as you want), cancel with ^ (can hold as long as you want) and then walk < through the rail.
