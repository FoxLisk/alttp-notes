Room is self explanatory if you don't get saha rupees.

For rupees, hold ^> entering, switch to ^ once against the torch.
Time an A press when link is about one 16x16 tile v> of Sahasrala. Keep holding up in case the text doesn't start - if this happens, move to stand beside Sahasrala, face left and talk.
Out of the text, hold ^ and lift both the right pot and top pot.

Not automatible from this point until after you have gotten the rupees.

Leaving Sahasrala's closet, hold v> through the transition until link moves slightly right, then begin your dash.
