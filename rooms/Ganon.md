# Phase 3

Ganon warps to a new location; as always he alternates between top and bottom.

When he lands, it's a 50/50 if he'll warp or not.

If he doesn't warp, he goes into a waiting phase for 30 frames. If you hit him during this, he warps out 180 frames later, drops a line of tiles, and does not spawn a spiral bat.

After those 30 frames, he goes into an active phase for 65 frames. If you hit him in this phase, he will drop a line of tiles and still spawn a spiral bat.

After those 65 frames, there are another 30 frames where you can slash him but it doesn't do anything at all.

Thus, an optimal phase 3 hit saves 98 frames (30 + 65 + a 183 vs a 180 frame warp) over a maximally bad phase 3 hit.

# Phase 4

AFAIK no one has written up an exhaustive explanation of what to do in every situation in phase 4. I am going to attempt to remedy that.

### Disclaimers:

  1. The strats here are my preference. Some situations permit multiple solutions. I will not be covering alternatives.
  1. I will not be covering capespins, and I have no advice for blue Ganon. This is a guide for a standard Ganon fight with no fancy stuff.
  1. It would be dope to have gifs for all of this, but who has the energy

### Terminology:

Ganon has 8 places he can warp to. He alternates between a bottom location and a top location; he has 4 options in each. I don't have names I love for these positions, so I'm going to call them Top 1-4 (T1, T2, ...) and Bottom 1-4 (B1, B2, ...), from the left. 


## Entering phase 4:

This defines a bunch of the fight.

### First early spin

There are 8 places ganon can be when you get the last hit in phase 3. In all of them, after the first hit you want to immediately slash away from Ganon and then move in close to him. There is 1 text box, and you release B during the hitbox so as to spin on the first frame after it, and get the "free early spin".

Ganon will *always* warp to the side (top/bottom) of the room he is already on after this first spin. If he warps to the spot he was already on (1/4 chance) you will get blue Ganon. Otherwise he will warp to one of the other three spots.

#### Second early spin

TODO: Learn & explain early doubles on more RNGs.

This is skippable, but on some RNGs saves a warp.

If you are interested in going for the second "free" spin (the "early double" as it is sometimes called), you want to control your knockback here to set up for the next spin. Personally I go for early doubles on Top 1-2 and Bottom 1-3. 



My strats:

##### Top RNG:

If, after the first spin, Ganon is at:

* T4 I bail on the early double.

* T3 I go for it depending on my mood.

* T1/2 I always go for it.


The plan is to have the second spin put me close enough to the lamp to get torch glitch and also bait the firebat. So I want to be able to spin off of ganon down-left towards the pit. If it's a short warp to T1, you can get all the way to the torch in time, but on some [TODO: Which?] RNGs, you have to spin into the pit to cancel momentum and then mash firerod down to get it.

So I go for a left- or left-down recoil, hoping to do a mostly-downwards but sometimes down-left spin for the double.

From T4 to T1 is probably not worth going for.

If he warps to T3 or T4, I bail.

If he goes to T1 or T2, I bait the bat towards the center and spin. If he was at T2 and warped to T1 or vice versa, you can get to the lamp and do torch glitch as normal. If he was at T3, you have to cancel momentum with the pit and mash to get torch glitch just in time. At T4 I don't try.

##### Bottom RNG:

I try to set up for an early double on all bottom RNGs. I don't actually go for the double if he warps to B4\*\*. 

I always get a left recoil on the first spin, and then

[should have a link to torch glitch]

Get torch glitch if you're struggling. "[Everybody knows](https://web.archive.org/web/20190831022348/https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/everybody-knows/)" that you don't need to get torch glitch if you have silvers. This advice is actually aimed at players who are comfortable with the gold sword/silver arrows Ganon fight; since this is the "beginner" route, many people assume that there is no meaningful differentiation within the group who get gs/sa, despite the fact that these people run the gamut from "die multiple times to ganon, regularly" to "have top 100 times on [src](https://www.speedrun.com/alttp#No_Major_Glitches)." If you are just now starting out, and you are having any trouble at all getting 4 silver arrows into Ganon, _get torch glitch_. It will help.
