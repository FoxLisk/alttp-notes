This category is using a hacked save file to start with full equipment and the escape completed. 

all dungeons must be completed, including agah, using the NMG ruleset, including no S&Q

1. spawn at link's house
1. swamp (like AD)
1. RUN to TT (faster than mirror/flute/portal)
1. TT (normally but no basement key/mitts)
1. SW (straight to back, pick up the normal pot key)

=====
these are 3 batches that you can do in whatever order you prefer, afaict.

1. flute 6
1. mire (NMG version til big key, then straight to vitty. dont hit the switch).
1. mirror out, desert mostly as normal

1. flute 5
1. pod (NMG until the way to hammerjump; instead use somaria for archery contest and finish the dungeon)
1. mirror out, eastern (NMG except dash wherever seems right to you lol. and you already have bow, getting it again will downgrade (!))

1. flute 7, IP as normal

=====

1. flute 1, TR as normal
1. Hera w/ herapot until it's banned, then NMG style (no moon pearl though)
1. GT as normal
1. AT as normal (AD style i guess)
1. Ganon


** is there a better way to combo mire and desert?
