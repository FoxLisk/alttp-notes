# Tempered fight:

# 1+1

Do the inputs. Pick your favourite strats from the ones on display [on the wiki](https://alttp-wiki.net/index.php/Ganon) and do them.

# Phase 3

Ganon warps to a new location; as always he alternates between top and bottom.

When he lands, it's a 50/50 if he'll warp or not.

If he doesn't warp, he goes into a waiting phase for 30 frames. If you hit him during this, he warps out 180 frames later, drops a line of tiles, and does not spawn a spiral bat.

After those 30 frames, he goes into an active phase for 65 frames. If you hit him in this phase, he will drop a line of tiles and still spawn a spiral bat.

After those 65 frames, there are another 30 frames where you can slash him but it doesn't do anything at all.

Thus, an optimal phase 3 hit saves 98 frames (30 + 65 + a 183 vs a 180 frame warp) over a maximally bad phase 3 hit.

# Phase 4

[should have a link to torch glitch]

Get torch glitch if you're struggling. "[Everybody knows](https://web.archive.org/web/20190831022348/https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/everybody-knows/)" that you don't need to get torch glitch if you have silvers. This advice is actually aimed at players who are comfortable with the gold sword/silver arrows Ganon fight; since this is the "beginner" route, many people assume that there is no meaningful differentiation within the group who get gs/sa, despite the fact that these people run the gamut from "die multiple times to ganon, regularly" to "have top 100 times on [src](https://www.speedrun.com/alttp#No_Major_Glitches)." If you are just now starting out, and you are having any trouble at all getting 4 silver arrows into Ganon, _get torch glitch_. It will help.
