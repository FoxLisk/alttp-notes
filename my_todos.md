This is a list of upcoming projects related to ALttP that I am doing, planning on doing, or considering doing.

See also [NMG League Bot issue list](https://github.com/FoxLisk/NMG-League-Bot/issues) for info on what I'm thinking about for the NMG League

# In Progress

Things I am already working on and intend to finish.

- [ ] Fox Construct - a new Twitch bot to do Blue Ball predictions (and more features in the future).
- [ ] ALttP WR rehosting - an archive of historical ALttP WRs. This is boring and tedious work so I'm not spending much time on it, but it will materialize eventually.

# Planned

Things I intend to get to, but have not yet started. Subject to change and reporioritization.

- [ ] Live room timings - a feature for Fox Construct to track and display room times during live speedruns, similar to the FunToon feature.
- [ ] Stream Guide - an update to EvilAsh's ancient, outdated guide on setting up your stream

# Considering

Things that I think are interesting ideas but I'm not sure will rise to the level of me actually doing them. Ideas are annotated with a number `[x/10]` that indicates my current feeling about how likely I am to get around to them.

- [ ] AD Route Megadoc `[7/10]` - a document that explains ~everything about All Dungeons routes. The idea is to cover old route and all of the tech/options available in new route.
- [ ] Scorigami `[5/10]` - a service to let people upload LiveSplit files and provide info on [scorigami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorigami)s.
- [ ] New Game+ romhack `[5/10]` - a romhack to start you with full equipment in Link's house (this is required because Zelda doesn't spawn if you already have MS+).
- [ ] Save Generator `[4/10]` - I already [have some save generators](https://foxlisk.com/dwnmg.html), but I think it would be nice to have a more general one.
- [ ] Hosted Route Comparison Timer `[4/10]` - I [have a tool for comparing routes by adding rooms together](/tools/compare_times.py), but currently it's annoying and manual to use; you have to write `yaml` and run a python script. It would be cool to make this publically easily available.
