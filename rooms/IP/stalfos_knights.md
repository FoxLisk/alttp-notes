First of all, in the prior room, fall in the top right corner of the bombable floor. The bomb hitbox is square, you are not safer standing in the top left and you lose time.

# Timing

To be honest I just looked at this room time when I was making this document and I don't have a good feeling for it. I'm getting 83x-85x and I don't have a great handle on where I'm losing frames yet.

# What

Your goal here is to spawn both stalfos knights, place a bomb such that it will hit both of them, and then knock the bottom knight up into the bomb explosion.

# Outline

Hold ^, pick up the pot and throw it. Make sure you walk high enough to spawn the top stalfos knight, and make sure you place a bomb such that it will hit both stalfos knights.

Walk v and then switch to <v when you're between the pot and the railing. When you reach the bottom left pot, pick it up and walk down.

After the bottom stalfos lands in front of you, tap ^ and throw the pot.

Align with the door and start your dash when the stalfos' chin touches his collarbone.

# Specifics

In the room, hold ^ and pick up the pot immediately above you. Walk up to at least Y-64C to start the top stalfos knight falling down. This is a few pixels before Link clears the top of the pot. You probably want to walk above the top of the pot to be sure. Place the bomb as you walk up.

Once you've walked high enough, walk v and switch to <v sometime while you're between the rail and the pot. You can place the bomb after you start walking down if you're having trouble placing it early enough or are generally nervous about messing up at the cost of a few frames.

Grab the bottom left pot and continue holding down until Link is flush with the wall.

The second stalfos knight will spawn and start dropping above Link. After he's landed, tap ^ and then A to throw the pot.

You can throw the pot too early, but the window for throwing the pot is very large and doing it fast does not save time (since you are waiting on the bomb fuse), so don't rush it.

If you hold ^ too long before throwing the pot, you will walk into the stalfos but you will still hit him and everything is fine except you won't have beams for conveyor. There's about a 5 frame window to throw in without getting hit.

# How it works

There is a global flag that the game sets for "will a bomb kill a stalfos knight right now?" When you knock down the second stalfos knight, this flag gets set, which means that both stalfos knights are vulnerable to the one bomb.

This will lead to massive confusion and frustration if the room goes badly, because if they are out of sync it becomes difficult to track what state the flag is in.

# Magic pot

The bottom right pot has magic in it. If you place the bomb kinda late (i.e. on your way back down) it's not too hard to pick up the bottom right pot first, then grab the bottom left pot from the right side on your way down and still throw the pot into the bottom stalfos knight fast enough to get the double kill. It is noticeably more difficult but manageable with some practice.
