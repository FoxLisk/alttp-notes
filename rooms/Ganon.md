Get torch glitch if you're struggling. "[Everybody knows](https://web.archive.org/web/20190831022348/https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/everybody-knows/)" that you don't need to get torch glitch if you have silvers. This advice is actually aimed at players who are comfortable with the gold sword/silver arrows Ganon fight; since this is the "beginner" route, many people assume that there is no meaningful differentiation between people who get gs/sa and those who don't, despite the fact that these people run the gamut from "die multiple times to ganon, regularly" to "have top 100 times on [src](https://www.speedrun.com/alttp#No_Major_Glitches)." If you are just now starting out, and you are having any trouble at all getting 4 silver arrows into Ganon, _get torch glitch_. It will help.
