In the Ganon fight, if you light the left torch before the right torch goes out, the right torch stays lit the whole fight.

The torch goes out shortly after the last tile falls after phase 3, for timing purposes.

If you're doing lamp torch glitch you can just spam.

If you're using fire rod, you probably want to watch for the torch going out, and then double-tap Y very fast. The game eats your input on the frame (?) that the torch goes out, so if you double-tap Y pretty fast, you'll always get only one shot but even if one input gets eaten, you'll light the torch.

You can also shoot the fire rod from farther away earlier, so that the torch goes out while the fire rod shot is travelling. This will save time on some RNGs, but is difficult to do correctly, and missing torch glitch is very bad.

TODO: how many frames of input are eaten?
