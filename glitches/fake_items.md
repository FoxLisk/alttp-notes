# Fake Items

"Fake Items" is a fairly bad name for a trick that allows you to use an item by menuing to it. The name comes from its main usage, which is activating Magic Powder while only having the Mushroom.

You are likely familiar with the simplest version of this trick: Try to place a Somaria block with no magic, cancel the textbox and instantly menu to Mushroom, and you get a Powder activation. But there's more to it!

The way it works is that you arm the state, and then you menu to one of the items that work, and then you get the item usage. The fakeable items are as follows:

* Mushroom (gives Powder effect; doesn't require magic)
* Powder (also gives Powder effect; doesn't require magic)
* Mirror
* Bow (requires an arrow to shoot it)

When you activate fake powder or fake bow, you can keep walking while using the item. With Fake Powder, this will also move you at "perfect pumping speed" because it resets your subpixels every frame for some reason.

# Setups

There are two known setups: using the Cane of Somaria with no magic, and Ledgepogging.

## Cane of Somaria

If you try to place a Somaria block while you don't have enough magic to do so, you'll get a text box telling you as much. After you close this textbox, if you menu quickly to one of the fakeable items listed above, you'll activate it.

## Ledgepogging

If you do an itemdash with certain items equipped off of certain ledges, you can arm a "fake items" setup

These items work for the itemdash:

* Hammer
* Bow
* Byrna
* Somaria
* Boomerangs
* Fire rod
* Ice rod
* Shovel
* Bug net

On these ledges:

* All underworld ledges
* North overworld ledges (i.e. ones where you itemdash facing up)

Then you can menu to one of the fakeable items above and get its effect.

# Stored Fake Items

If, instead of menuing to the item you want to activate, you menu to certain _other_ items instead, you can store the Fake Item usage. Then you can menu to the fakeable item and get its effect later. 

The items that work for storing a state are:

* Bombs
* Hookshot
* Medallions
* Lamp
* Book
* Bottles
* Cape

While you have Fake Items stored you can't use any of the items that store it.

The things that break a stored Fake Item state are:

* Menuing to any item that doesn't store the state
* Kicking up boots dust
* Picking up an object such as a bush
* Underworld/overworld transitions
* Falling in a pit

And probably others, this list is not intended to be exhaustive.
