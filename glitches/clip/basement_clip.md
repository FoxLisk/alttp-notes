This clip can be thought of in three steps:

1. [Getting Superspeed](#getting-superspeed)
2. [Teleport](#teleport)
3. [Rail clip](#rail-clip)

# Getting Superspeed

First we have to get superspeed before we teleport into the rail. There are two ways to do this:

## With a potion

1. Get all the way into the spiral staircase
   1. You can get hit by an antifairy if there's one around
   2. You can bomb snap
   3. You can just walk to the pixel
2. Spindash
3. "YBA" (i.e. press press ^+Y on the same frame. Make sure you are actually missing some of the resource the potion refills. It's not an actual YBA)

## With Somaria

1. Place a slot 0 block (place a block, blow it up, place another while the beams are on screen)
2. Spindash
3. Stand next to the block
4. Lamp a couple times and pick up the block
5. Run into the spiral stairs (you can't go up, but you will get superspeed)

# Teleport

With superspeed armed, we next need to teleport into the corner of the rail. 

How to read these notes:

    all inputs are 1 frames unless otherwise specified: 

    >2 means "2 frames right" 
    v>{1-2} means "1 or 2 frames downright"
    <h means "press left, hold it as long as you want" 
    a^ means "dashturn up" 
    

`^ >2 v` - if you only move 1 frame right, you can go v and then v> to get all the way in  
`^> v ^> v`  
`v>h` - this will move you deeper in the wall. if it doesnt you need to redo theprevious two `^> v` motions

`<^ < v>` (this is the teleport)

For most of these steps if you miss a diagonal you can just tap v to get back in the wall and only have to retry one of the steps again. I'm not going to list every single retry point out though, sorry.

# Rail Clip

Finally, we need to get inside the railing.

What we're going to do here is basically move 4 pixels down inside the rail, and then move into position to bomb ourselves to a pixel we can use to dash far enough left to get all the way through. This trick is much easier with Somaria; methods with and without are both covered.

## With Somaria

Thanks to RequiemOfSpirit for finding this much easier method and writing it up.

To start, hold left to move into the rail, and tap A to clear spinspeed while holding left. Then menu to Somaria. Then, for the 4 pixels down:

1. 1st pixel down
   a. Place a block, and swap to `<v` during the cane animation and keep holding `<v`.
   a. After Link finishes pushing the block, explode the block and release the dpad during the cane animation. Link should be facing downwards at this point.
   a. `v>` for 1 or 2 frames
   a. Press and hold `<`
1. 2nd pixel down
   1. Same as 1st pixel
1. 3rd pixel down
   1. Place a block
   1. Roll from `<` to `<v`
   1. Next you need a clean release of the dpad, a 1f `>` input, and then a 1-2f `v>` input
1. 4th pixel down
   1. Hold left. Don't place a new somaria block, but repeat the remaining steps above
1. Clipping inside
   1. Press and hold `<`
   1. Roll to `<v`
   1. Buffer a clean switch to `<^`
   1. Explode the block and release the dpad during the cane animation
       1. Link should be facing up after this step
   1. Place bomb
   1. Slash and hold sword out
   1. Buffer 1f `>`
   1. After the explosion, start a dash and turn left
      1. You have to actually start the dash, and you can keep dashing as long as you want
   1. Hold up after the dash and switch to up-left or left to clip in

## Without Somaria

We repeat a sequence several times that moves link down 1 pixel at the end. We do this to move Link a total of 4 pixels down. But first we have to get into the rail and end superspeed.

```
<h - first we have to get into the rail with superspeed still active  
a  - then we cancel it  
   <v > av v>{1-2} (1)
<h <v > av v>{1-2} (2)  
<h <v > av v>{1-2} (3)  
<h <v > av v>{1-2} (4) - Link should now be on Y-5E  
```

If you get a 2 frame movement on any of the `>`s here, you can slash your sword and move backwards

If you moved 2 frames `v>` on the last step, make sure to walk `<`. You can always walk `<` for safety if you wish.

`>` slash and hold sword  
`<h` - make sure Link is backed up all the way  
`<v{1-2}`  
release sword now  
`a^`  

now place a bomb, hold sword out and move 1f right.
After you get hit, dash left (for as long as you want), cancel with ^ (can hold as long as you want) and then walk < through the rail.

## With Somaria

```
<h - first we have to get into the rail with superspeed still active
a  - then we cancel it
```

Menu to somaria

```
1.  Buffer <v with cane animation
2.  Buffer dpad release by breaking the block
3.  v>{1-2}
4.  <h
Repeat steps 1-4

5.  Hold <, place somaria, and then roll to <v
7.  slash buffer a clean dpad release
8.  > av v>{1-2}
9.  <h then roll to <v
10.  slash buffer a clean dpad release
11.  > av v>{1-2}
12.  <h then roll to <v
13. Slash buffer a clean switch to <^h
14. Buffer dpad release by breaking the block

At this point, link should be facing up.

15. Place bomb
16. Hold sword out and 1f >
```

After you get hit by the bomb, turndash left. Once the dash starts, tap `^` and then roll to `<^` or `<` to get inside the cage
