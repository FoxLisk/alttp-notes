This is the overworld section going from the Big Key back to the Fire Rod.

# Ropa Respawning

I'm not going to explain the movement on the whole screen right now, I just want to document the Ropa's behaviour.

There's a Ropa that spawns to the left of the 3x3 of bushes. When you first load the screen, this Ropa immediately jumps towards you and lands sort of between the tree and the skull.

After this, you dash up the ribcage and then dash right through the top Ropa. If your dash right is too high here, the first Ropa will despawn. Empirically, if you nudge the top of the ribcage on your dash right, or if you're 1 pixel above that, the Ropa will not respawn, and if you're any higher than that, he will. It's possible this is slightly inaccurate and his initial movement might affect it somewhat.

On your dash back down the ribcage, the Ropa will jump at you again. Where he's jumping _from_ will be significantly different depending on whether or not you despawned him on your dash up.

If you went high and despawned him, he will respawn and jump at you from just to the left of the 3x3 of bushes:

If you stayed low on the dash, the Ropa will be jumping at you from where he landed earlier:

# Conclusion

So! What do we do about this? Personally, I try to keep the Ropa spawned and take a high dash. The high dash seems to be pretty unsafe if you respawn the Ropa, but pretty safe if you don't. Many players instead opt to take a low dash. I think this is mostly preference. The top dash has a fairy bush, which means you won't advance the bush prize pack as much, so if you are worried about the skull bush I think it's better. But it's not a big deal.
