Fake clippers is a technique for clipping into a wall inside swamp with fake flippers.

# Fake Flippers

This is a regular splashless swim setup. The normal thing to do here is to lamp 3x to set a high search index, then shoot 6 arrows into the wall, lay 2 bombs, and jump in the water.

# Entrance

This is useful in rando to collect the Swamp prize without flippers. Thanks to [Joshua in the rando discord](https://discord.com/channels/307860211333595146/741638618090569738/1065416273363730433) for figuring out the inputs.

First, get into the water in fake flippers. Then swim to the staircase on the right (that takes you to the statue landing).

From here, line up high on the stairs. I don't know the exact range here, sorry.

To clip left we do the following.

    1. < for 1 frame
    2. <v for several frames.

over and over again. I don't know the exact allowable length of <v presses. Possibly 2-8 frames.

Once you're deep in the wall you can hold <v to keep swimming, but until you're pretty far in that will cause you to pop out.

Once you get to the ladder you can swim up. You have to dodge the spike and the phelps to get to the door.

A strat that worked for me here was:

    1. Wait in the bottom right of the platform until the phelps are above me
    2. Wait for the spike to hit the left wall, then
    3. Swim left and then up



# Second Flooded Room

This is useful if you're coming from Hera and want to flood swamp, e.g. on your way to Swamp big chest

## Fast setup

This is fast and not very hard, but you only get one shot.

After you hop in the water, hold down and switch to <^ at a coordinate between Y-71 and Y-75.

After you move <^ a bit link will do an autoswim thing because of the stairs. Let go of the dpad during this, then once you come to a rest, tap v to snap up and tap > to snap left.

From here you need to hold <v but let go of v for 1f. After you do 1f of < back into <v, Link will start swimming slowly to the left.

Once the back of Link's hat is past the rail, switch to v. this will align you with the ladder. then swim ^ into the platform, then v will hop you out of the water and ^ will let you walk back onto dry land

You can do some of this faster by not aligning so carefully but then it's tricky and can fuck you

## Top Swim

You can swim higher up and clip into the top rail somehow. I don't really know how, just mentioning it for completeness I suppose.

## Slower setup

You can use the auto swim to get Link wedged deep in the bottom wall and then do a longer clipping swim to the left. [I explained this on stream once](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/877518315).

This is slower than the other setups but retryable.
