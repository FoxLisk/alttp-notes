Tojso hookpush

1. 2 bombs facing up [direction probably doesn't matter but i didn't test], red boom east
1. after the red boom starts moving back left, lamp twice and do the 2 hooks v. you want the 2nd hook to happen after a lamp flame is gone.
1. walk back up, 2 bombs, boom east. 2 flames and hook to activate
   * if you're down a bomb, 1 bomb and 3 flames works too (make sure you get both magic pots if you were otherwise trying to skip one)

6. walk up, qh
7. dash down til you're at the bottom of the pancake
8. dash right til you're at the end of the / slope and walk up into hera

---

Ganonpot:

1. Line up with the pot horizontally then move 1px left
2. Line up vertically: look at back of link's hat against the dark column of px in the pot. if the vertical bar of links hat is lined up with the top of the bar in the pot, you're good; the 2px below that are also good
3. Place a bomb (facing left!)
4. Move up 7 pixels
5. *face left again*
6. dashturn, hookshot, tap < then <^

---

Hookpush to Triforce:

misslot a hook:
   * dodge trident
   * stand around 1/3 down from the top of the room facing a wall
   * 3 arrows in wall
   * face torch, hold sword out, 2 bombs OR bomb + boomerang
   * hook
   * RELEASE SWORD
   * hook again

this makes it so that the first hook gets misslotted (it eats a sparkle instead of an arrow), and *the second hook gets slotted correctly* into 0-4. specifically it will replace an arrow and be in slots 2-4.

now throw the boom east. this means we will read hookpushing data from slot 1. it's important that we don't read hookpushing data from where the hook actually was, because its direction is down which is not helpful

go to the top of the room and place two bombs while facing up, then face left or right.

when they start exploding, lamp twice (direction shouldnt matter ?) and then MASH hook out of the menu

if all goes well, the 0-4 slots will be filled with [bomb explosion, bomb explosion, lamp, lamp, hook]. the lamps and hook might be in a different order, it shouldn't matter. these ancilla are all too stronk for the hookshot; it will fail to spawn, and we will read data from slot 1 (as set by the boomerang), which should by this point be 0B from the bomb explosion with direction set to north.


** is it possible to place the bombs facing up, then turn down, slash, hook, drop slash and re-hook? do we get sparkles in time?

## Ganonpot thingy:

1. YBA east with sword held out
1. <v (sword still out) for 4f (bottom of sword will line up somewhat obviously with bottom of pot)
1. stand still for a frame or more
1. <v (sword STILL OUT) for 5f more (1 pixel between bottom of pot and top of sword)\
   so far this is just the beginning of normal ganonpot.
1. now we release spin and buffer <^. after the first frame of straight-vertical movement, stop moving. you are now in the final position.
