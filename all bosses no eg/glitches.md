## Deathhole

NOTE: If you do something wrong with a bomb, make sure you let it fully finish exploding and be off screen before you place a new bomb to try again. Placing the 2nd bomb while there's one on screen will put it in slot 0 and the deathhole will crash.

 1. be at <= 1 heart
 1. stand on a good Y pixel (6D1/6D2) with your back to the left wall.
 1. bombdash
 1. out of the bonk, hold up
 1. slash once before falling
 1. You will now die and the screen gets fucked. hold v and you'll fall for real and be active on the bottom floor, but the door is deleted.
 1. maybe menu to mirror during the fall since your menu is solid black at this point


## Statue Drag

[This has its own page now](/glitches/transition_corruption/statue_drag.md)

## Overworld Conveyor
 
 (starts ~1:20:40 in Chex's tutorial)

 1. Get yourself lined up against the first / slope in the ether tablet island
 1. Lamp 3 times facing up (or left or down, but NOT RIGHT)
 1. Hold sword out
 1. Shoot 3 arrows
 1. Quickly menu to bombs
 1. Do a "Bomb Dust" (kick up dust and lay 2 bombs)
   * Basically this is tap A and then mash Y. you want to place both bombs while the dust is still on the screen, but you have to let go of A before you can place bombs
   * this feels quite finicky so far
 1. pick up a bomb, throw it, pick up another bomb
 1. after the bomb hits you is when you can release sword

## North Somaria
 (starts ~1:48:00)

 1. Place a somaria block semi inside the door. Do this by abutting the  wall facing north slightly to the left of the left edge of the doorway.
    * or by being a couple pixels away from the wall, which makes the horizontal range wider
 1. Hold Link's sword out to the left and walk into the door.
    * if you can't, the block is too far to the right (probably)
 1. Pick up the block.
 1. Tap v (this snaps you into position)
 1. Tap ^ 
 1. Throw the block
 1. Tap ^ (this jukes the transition)

Now you get rid of the block however and leave the door, i.e. by holding down, throwing the block, and dashing out.

## East Somaria
 (Starts ~1:50:00)

 1. Hold your sword out facing down.
 1. Step into a doorway to align yourself vertically
 1. Step far enough out of the doorway to place a block (not very precise)
 1. Step back into the doorway pretty far and pick it up
 1. Throw it upwards
 1. Walk deeper in the door
 1. Turn back to the left and pick it up
 1. tap to the left again while you're holding it
 1. the block should now be cut roughly in half by the wall 
  * this is visible even on my shitty TV that's missing a billion pixels
  * you should be on X-6E8
 1. now you want to move 2px to the right.
  * Chex recommends: throw block, dash-buffer right twice.
  * I got it first try doing similar: throw block, dash buffer once, repeat
  * you want to land on X-6EA
  * if there's 1 px of white in the middle of the block showing, you're in the right place
  * alternatively, there should be a vertical line of 2 white pixels to the left of the somaria block
 1. tap to the left (this jukes the transition)

 1. throw the block, dash-buffer to the left a couple times. 2 or 3 frames to the left seem fine
 1. tap right (while the block is _on the ground_) and you done baby (this is the 2nd juke)
    
 TODO: this causes massive graphical corruption, is that... bad?

## South Somaria

 (Starts ~2:00:00)
 (demo with link visible at ~2:10:00)

 1. pick up a block, walk into the door (it won't let you; this is just to line up)
 1. throw the block while still holding down so you get into the door
 1. face up and grab the block
 1. throw the block left and move down some more
 1. pick the block up and tap ^ to snap down
   * if done right the doorframe should roughly slice the block in 2
 1. throw the block again and tap v a bit
 1. pick up the block again
   1. if you see sweat droplets during the pickup, ???
   1. if not it's propbably still fine?
 1. tap ^ to snap down

Now you can do two things to complete the snap. The new method is described well [on the wiki](https://alttp-wiki.net/index.php/Door_Juke#Technique_with_Somaria:). The old method of select buffering while watching the somaria block move in the air is slower but you have better cues during it.

### Old method:

 1. throw the block to the left and pause quickly
   * if the block appears SUPER low on the screen, going left, you're good
   * if not, tap ^, pick up the block, tap ^ to snap down again
 1. once the block is moving to the left from the weird place and you're paused, menu to bombs
 1. place the bomb and select buffer
 1. use the somaria block's movement in the air to select buffer 2 frames downward
  * this gets you to AE3
 1. pick up the bomb
 1. tap ^ (snap to AE8)
 1. Throw the bomb
 1. walk v a bunch (Chex goes as low as B06 which is like over a tile)
 1. hold ^ to transition into thieves town

## Bomb Juke

  (Starts ~2:04:40)

 1. Abut the south wall, nudge into the door a bit to make sure you're placing it pretty deep
 1. place the bomb
 1. walk down into the door pretty far
 1. pick up the bomb
 1. tap ^ to snap down (to AE0)
 1. throw the bomb
    * if link's hat isn't on screen you're fine
 1. place another bomb
 1. do 2 frames south 
    * use the zazak's animation to time this
    * or do the sword out method the same as the south somaria above
      * TODO: can you do the sword out thing before placing the bomb to have more time?
 1. pick up the bomb, tap ^ to snap, throw the bomb, walk down. you'll come down from the top of the screen.

## West Somaria

  (Starts about 2:23:00)

This is like a combination of North and East somarias. You do a setup more like an East, but then you don't have to do the extra back and forth buffers

 1. Sword out, facing down, place the block outside the door so you can pick it up
 1. Walk into the door, pick up the block
 1. throw it upward
 1. walk farther left, grab it, snap
 1. repeat until you're deep in the wall (with the block not in your hands, only your shield is visible)
 1. tap <

## Slot 9 Block

 1. Place a block.
  * It needs to be fairly far away from collision in cardinal directions so the beams can stay in the air long enough for us to do the other steps
 1. Slash and hold your sword
 1. Break the block
 1. Kick up dust
 1. Place another block

These have to be done fairly quickly. The 2nd block has to be placed while the beams from the first block & the dash dust are all on screen.

Occasionally you'll get a slot 8 block because of, effectively, bad luck.

If your sword spin charges fully in the middle of the process you're almost guaranteed to get a slot 8 block. If this is happening to you, try holding B until charged before doing the break/dust/block sequence.

## Mire Hookpush

## North Hookpush

These all describe a hookpush that moves you north enough to get past a screen transition; it's used 2x in mire and optionally once to skip Desert torches.

 1. Lamp 3x as setup
 1. Slot 9 block
 1. Dash-block
 1. Break block and beam up *at something besides a wall* (pot, torch, rail)
 1. Hook down from the top right corner inside the fishbone maze, pause when the hook hits the rail.

You can retry the hook-pause thing as much as you want. If you're early you can catch it and switch to select buffers to get it.

Old hookpush (requires boom)

  (Starts about 3:10)

 1. Lamp 3x as setup
 1. hold sword out
 1. 3 arrows
 1. menu to boom, throw it v>
 1. immediately menu to fire rod, shoot up
 1. as soon as the fire rod hits the wall, lay a block
 1. you want 2c in slot 9
 1. walk up into the maze, go into the top right corner, and hook down
 1. kill vitty`

## Somaria-Only Hookpush

  (starts at about 3:15:33)

Requires beams

 1. Lamp 3x (left or up)
 1. Hold sword out
 1. place and break a somaria block
 1. kick up dust and place another somaria block during the explosion (gets you a slot-9 block if done correctly)
 1. dash-block
 1. break the block and beam up
 1. dash-block
 1. dash-beam down
 1. walk up above the torch, dash turn down, and dust-hook (you have to kick up dust to get the push)

Haven't found a great setup to not accidentally pick up a block or some dumb thing like that while avoiding the medusa. Link's direction only matters while beaming though, afaict anyway (after the initial lamps).

## Bomb snap

  (starts ~3:29:00)

 1. place a bomb in the door. The one in swamp is an auto door, so i'm holding my sword out, lining up with the non-autodoor part of the wall to the right, and then pulling back to the left
 1. walk a few steps into the door and pick up the bomb
 1. throw the bomb
   1. method A:
     * wait for the bomb to blow up
     * place another bomb (either facing up, then pick up and throw, or just face left)
     * wait for it to flash 2 times, then tap ^ followed quickly by A
   1. method b:
     * pick up the bomb and throw it again and then do the ^ and A without wasting a bomb
 1. you should now be at Y-510
