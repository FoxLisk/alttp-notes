Line up against the top of the 4 o'clock armos, with link roughly in the gap between armoses.

1. Shoot < ^ << (kills an armos) all asap while holding the relevant directiosn
1. Shoot vvv (kills an armos) while holding v. you want to get link to around Y-97A (his shadow just below the tile border) for the next shot
1. shoot <. hold ^> out of this shot and shoot ^. this requires a bit of finesse to time because if you go early you'll shoot a blank.
1. tap > to turn and shoot 3 arrows right. Don't hold > between shots, we want to stay to the left
1. hold <^ out of the last shot and shoot up once (slightly lazy, you want some movement)
1. hold > out of this and shoot immediately
1. hold ^ (not <^!) and shoot once
1. hold <^ out of that shot and shoot ^ at the left armos
1. hold ^ and shoot again immediately (you don't want to move, but if you do move ^ is fine
1. hold > and shoot the last guy and go pick up the heart.
