[0] yoho's fake clippers notes 

yeah it's basically
  1. get close to the bottom of the rail
  2. hold <v and tap up until you're snapped in line with the rail
  3. like 3 1f releases of v while holding <v until you start moving automatically through the rail
  4. once link starts moving diagonally hold down
  5. tap > once you jump out of swim state and walk out (this is assuming you're on the right side of the half ladder bullshit which you should be)

[1]

from ether:

  1. run to the bottom of the mountain
  1. wrap screen, dw with broken camera
  1. run down (this is all like going to GT in old AD route so far)
  1. run to the left. at the last `\_` curve, hookdash again and cut through.
  1. hold <^ to line up high, walk < til you can't anymore, then wiggle <v until link is ~1 body width from the side of the screen (x ~= 614)
  1. walk down, quickhop. you get a huge multi-screen fall
  1. walk down & quickhop again
  1. transition left
  1. walk <^ to get a dash lane and dash through the transition
  1. dash left, qh up when you get a chance, dash left again
  1. dash ^ when you're to the left of the 2x2 swamp lotus
    1. this will wrap you north twice. immediately after the second wrap, cancel dash
  1. walk > until you're at the _ part of the \_
    1. this also lines you up sort of halfway into the vertical row of small flowers in the swamp
  1. dash up until the thing that would bonk you. this is the thing inside the platform with the ether tablet
  1. walk around it and ether
  1. enjoy fabulous lightning bolt

[2]

  1. On the farthest-left slope near the flute 6 spot, sword out and dash buffer in left until you hop
  1. hop left, transition left
  1. after transition, tap ^
  1. then hop left
  1. then be very careful not to move right until you get the ice rod

there is a new (Lui-found) zora DMD, but i don't understand it yet.
