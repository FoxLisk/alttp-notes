AD route thru kiki skip/pod reload

(this means: lonk, OW EG out, do eastern first (FAWT or citrus), DMA to mirror, kiki skip, open the first door and reload the dungeon)

Make sure to get rupees at Saha if you are going to do the Ice Rod hookpush.

# PoD:

  * Go directly to the bridge and [deathhole](glitches.md#deathhole) to get to the big key. grab bombs/arrows
  * Go hammeryump.
  * [Statue Drag](glitches.md#statue-drag)
  * Kill Helma

# Escape:

  * Save & Quit (you are put automatically into sanc)
  * river clip, etc, etc, you know the drill 
  * skip boom
  * s&q and mirror after princess

# Thieves (/Collection):

  * Save & Quit to old man
  * Hera clip
  * Walk far enough into the room that you're definitely not in door state
  * Leave again, activate spinspeed high on the stairs (like, 4 steps below you high)
  * if you fuck up spinspeed, just walk to the bridge and dash left
  * Now do [overworld conveyor](glitches.md#overworld-conveyor)
  * In the ow conveyor state, hold up to walk along the slope. this will put you on X-6FF
    * From here, hold your sword out and do 1-frames to the left. If you pop way to the left, back off and start trying again. if you nudge 1 frame right, let yourself get conveyed into lost woods. Hold sword charge here! There are tiles somewhere on the next screen that fuck up your $EF value and put you in EG in mire.
    * Make sure your 1-frames nudge you over a pixel; you have to be on X-700 for the fall into the pit to work!
  * This will eventually carry you to something that, at least, *looks* like the ether medallion island again. Make sure your sword is held out no later than now
  * Release the spin on either the 2nd frame Link is on Y-E1A or the first frame he's on Y-E19
    1. E1C is when, between link's shield and the dark shadow, there's 1 pixel of dirt and then 2 pixels of dirt on the right: like a little triangle, long on the right.
    1. Once you get there, you're moving 1px every other frame.
    1. When you move up 1 pixel, you're on E1B. Now the left pixel of dirt is gone, and there's 1 pixel of dirt left in the second column
    1. When you move up 1 pixel, you're on E1A, but you can't spin yet. You have to wait 1 frame; select buffer until you see the sword sparkles change.
    1. You could also wait 2 frames, so if you see Link move 1 pixel all is not necessarily lost
    1. Cancel the final select buffer WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN B

  * Continue being conveyed for another transition.
    * If you're on the wrong layer, you can pause and mirror, which will put you back into the right layer, still in the conveyor state.
    * if you're on the wrong layer and *can't* mirror, you slashed or armed spinspeed too low or dashed through the bad X co-ord outside of Hera. (can this be fixed?)
  * After the screen transition, wait until link's head is just touching the topmost line of rocks (the "bottom-most", vertically; the one closest to the pit) and dash turn down to bonk onto the platform with the chest
    * if you bonk too early you get into EG
    * if you bonk too late you softlock
    * good luck
    * the safe way to do this is to tap < early, tap v to kick into the right pixel, tap < and dashturn again. you can do this too early as well though.
  * You can get the big key here for cave state big key if you want to skip the Desert hookpush later.
  * Follow the path for a while (or MIRE BOMB JUMP), go hit the switch in the bari room
  * go to somaria. you can get the arrows from the hub if you like. Now it's time for:

# DOOR GLITCHES

  * we are going to delete the trinexx door
  * go left one room, open the keydoor on the left. 
  * [North Somaria](glitches.md#north-somaria)
  * [East Somaria](glitches.md#east-somaria)

# Finish Collection/TT

  * S&Q Link's house

  * [Bomb Juke](glitches.md#bomb-juke) south
  * Get Mitts
  * Leave TT
    * Go upstairs, keydashing into the staircase
    * tap right in conveyor toilet before anything else
    * open up the hallway door on your way out
  * Reload TT
  * There's 5 rupees in the pot at the NE of the first room if you have < 10
  * do TT as normal (big key, attic, optionally get bombs in the attic) UNTIL
  * after rescuing the maiden, do a [west somaria](glitches.md#west-somaria) out of the jail room
  * after the west somaria, dash right until just about at the wall, then dash left until just about at the door, to fix the camera
  * then walk > and ^> until you're up against the little wall around the conveyor
  * [North somaria](glitches.md#north-somaria) in this door
  * leave the room to the east, avoiding the somaria pits
    * hold v> until you're like halfway between the middle of the room and the east wall, then walk into the door
  * in the swamp room, hold <^ until you get to the stairs, then walk up and open the hookshot
  * exit by dashing through the bottom-right door (the one you'd normally enter by in nmg)
    * you want to exit the bottom-right door without moving left, and then do it again
    * if you move to the left, you want to transition left and then exit the bottom-right door again
  * quickhop left
  * dash up (you will appear in the corridor with the pot key)
  * walk slightly left, then up (you will down(?) some stairs) and dash out of the room
    * these are probably the stairs you normally walk down before dashing into the pot key room
  * tap ^ a little (not too much! don't wanna fall in the pit!)
  * hold ^ to walk into, and then open, the moon pearl chest
  * mirror
 
# Finish TT
  * just go kill blind now
    * DON'T MIRROR OUT OF BLIND THINKING YOU ARE HOLDING A HAMMER
    * LSD blind is mandatory. You can do minecraft blind if you're brave but then you have to do the IR hookpush in mosaic state.

# Skull Woods
  * Mirror immediately to fix FDW
  * Frogdor (or whatever)
  * there's 5 rupees in the light world tree outside of smith screen

If you're doing the ice rod hookpush:

  * Run to the shop
  * Do the [Ice Rod Hookpush](glitches.md#ice-rod-hookpush)
  * Get the ice rod and leave
  * Dash back to portal
  * Run to SW

If you're skipping the hookpush, get tempered as normal and head to SW.
  
  * enter left pit
  * north somaria
  * get big key
  * leave via right door
  * get fire rod (bonk out, the fall doesnt help)
  * go kill moth
    * you can north somaria in the first room of skull exit, but that crashes on my machine

# Turtle Rock

  * if you didn't do IR hookpush, get ice rod:
    1. you need at least 2 bombs
    1. bridge screen right of link's house: downward teleport on 3rd hump on the left slope
    1. dash over to the right, nudge above the invisible collision
    1. on the next screen, dash right
    1. out of the dash, quickhop down
    1. hold <v until you start walking straight down
    1. switch to v> until you hit the transition

    1. walk into ice rod cave

  * s&q mountain
# Turtle Rock

  * mirror wrap
  * kill trinexx (you do not need big key!)

# Agah 2 (?)

  * in the platform lobby, quadrant glitch going upwards (Y-900)
    * the first frame that the platform totally covers the bloack line before the -| joint is 901, the frame after that is when to release
  * north somaria the top right door
  * walk down out of the door, then back into the door
    * the screen will go nots
  * hold v
  * dash left to enter the agah 2 fight
  * kill agah 2
  * CLIPE

# Mire
 
  * run over to mire (yes, you just have to hoof it)
  * clip in
  * go into the dungeon
  * follow normal route until pot key, then go up to fishbone room (!)
  * Lamp 3 times
  * [HONK PUNCH](glitches.md#mire-hookpush)
  * Once in the room with Vitty's big key door, do another hookpush
    * the only difference from the last one is you throw the boom \<v. make sure to go far enough down before shooting the firerod shot though.
    * If you're skipping boom, the hookpush is the same as last time.
  * If doing desert hookpush, set the search index after killing vitty, before refill.
  
# Desert

  * Mirror
  * Go kill lanmo
    * If you're skipping cave state big key & doing the hookpush here, you'll have to do a north hookpush
    * You want 1.25 small pots of magic left after killing lanmo to do the fanfare skip on arrghus. You can get a pot of magic in desert torches.
  * mirror out after the heart but before the pendant
  * go back to left desert entrance
  * Do the [arrghus deathhole](https://alttp-wiki.net/index.php/Deathhole#Arrghus_Deathhole)
  * kill arrghus
    * There's a 0 cycle possible but it sucks, I just do hookdash strats and go for a 1 cycle
  * fanfare skip

  * walk back into Swamp
  * another hookpush:
    * Set search index
    * Slot 9 block
    * Dust-block
    * Break + beam right
    * Dust-block after the block beams go away
    * walk down the stairs
    * dust-beam right
    * walk up the stairs a tile or so to your right
    * walk a step right, dash turn up
    * dust-hook (hook is v>)
  * hold ^ through the transition, then v> when you're in to walk around some collision and catch the crystal

# Ice

  * s&q
  * link's house
    * if you have arrows and bombs, use them for splashless (search index should be set correctly from the last hookpush if you beamed fast after breaking the block)
      * this means go right one screen, down one screen. then shoot 3 arrows & place 2 bombs and hop in the lake
    * otherwise, go only one screen right
      * then clip below the transition, run over to the right side
      * line up around somewhere roughly around Y-BDF (shadow aligned with the bottommost visible rock in the ground pattern) and transition right
      * dash off
      * hop (or quickhop) right and hold ^
  * swim into ice
  * do it (bomb clip, icebreaker, you know the drill)

# Hera

  * s&q mountain
  * clip into hera
  * hera pot
  * kill the boss
  * Fanfare skip

# Agahnim
  * Re enter Hera
  * go through beetles room, leave switch red
  * somaria juke east:
    * like an east somaria, but after you do the 2 1fs right and tap left to juke the transition, just throw the block, and then once it's landed walk right a bit and back left
    * Instead of doing 2 1fs right, you can slash the beetle, which will move you to the correct position.
  * leave this room to the north.
  * Now you're in Agah cutscene room kind of I think. go left, dash up, go right, slash the curtain
  * Dash up to near the top of the screen
  * Dash left
    * only some pixels work, this sucks. I don't have a good setup yet.
  * Now you're visually in Agah's arena, but you need to dash left once until you wrap back around to the right
  * kill agahnim

# win the game
  * you know what it is
