# Getting the book

It is common to tell people to hold v> after grabbing the book for a chance to walk down between the first two bookshelves if you are late starting your dash. This is fine if you like it but is extremely unlikely to help.

Whether or not this works depends on the pixel you pick up the book on, which depends on your walking pattern: if you walk into the book at E3B it won't work, and if you pick it up on E3A, it will work. But!

If you:

	1. nudge on the bookcase on your dash up and
	2. cancel with < and make it into the gap and
	3. don't pump,

you will always pick up the book on E3A (so the v> thing will not do any good).


If you're on grid (because you nudged the bookshelf on the way up, which you almost always will) all of the pixels on which holding < gets you in the gap set you on the same walking pattern that picks up the book on E3A.
