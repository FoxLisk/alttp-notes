AD route thru kiki skip/pod reload

# PoD:

  * Go directly to the bridge and [deathhole](glitches.md#deathhole) to get to the big key. grab bombs/arrows
  * Go hammeryump.
  * [Statue Drag](glitches.md#statue-drag)
  * Kill Helma

# Escape:

  * Save & Quit (you are put automatically into sanc)
  * river clip, etc, etc, you know the drill 

# Thieves (/Collection):

  * Save & Quit to old man
  * Hera clip
  * Walk far enough into the room that you're definitely not in door state
  * Leave again, activate spinspeed high on the stairs (like, 4 steps below you high)
  * if you fuck up spinspeed, just walk to the bridge and dash left
  * Now do [overworld conveyor](glitches.md#overworld-conveyor)
  * In the ow conveyor state, hold up to walk along the slope. this will put you on X-6FF
    * From here, hold your sword out and do 1-frames to the left. If you pop way to the left, back off and start trying again. if you nudge 1 frame right, let yourself get conveyed into lost woods. Hold sword charge here! There are tiles somewhere on the next screen that fuck up your $EF value and put you in EG in mire.
  * This will eventually carry you to something that, at least, *looks* like the ether medallion island again. Make sure your sword is held out no later than now
  * Release the spin on either the 2nd frame Link is on Y-E1A or the first frame he's on Y-E19
    1. E1C is when, between link's shield and the dark shadow, there's 1 pixel of dirt and then 2 pixels of dirt on the right: like a little triangle, long on the right.
    1. Once you get there, you're moving 1px every other frame.
    1. When you move up 1 pixel, you're on E1B. Now the left pixel of dirt is gone, and there's 1 pixel of dirt left in the second column
    1. When you move up 1 pixel, you're on E1A, but you can't spin yet. You have to wait 1 frame; select buffer until you see the sword sparkles change.
    1. You could also wait 2 frames, so if you see Link move 1 pixel all is not necessarily lost
    1. Cancel the final select buffer WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN B

  * Continue being conveyed for another transition.
    * If you're on the wrong layer, you can pause and mirror, which will put you back into the right layer, still in the conveyor state.
    * if you're on the wrong layer and *can't* mirror, you slashed or armed spinspeed too low or dashed through the bad X co-ord outside of Hera. (can this be fixed?)
  * After the screen transition, wait until link's head is just touching the topmost line of rocks (the "bottom-most", vertically; the one closest to the pit) and dash turn down to bonk onto the platform with the chest
    * if you bonk too early you get into EG
    * if you bonk too late you softlock
    * good luck
    * the safe way to do this is to tap < early, tap v to kick into the right pixel, tap < and dashturn again. you can do this too early as well though.
  * open the chest and get the big key (this is cave state big key!)
  * Follow the path for a while (or MIRE BOMB JUMP), go hit the switch in the bari room
  * go to somaria. you can get the arrows from the hub if you like. Now it's time for:
