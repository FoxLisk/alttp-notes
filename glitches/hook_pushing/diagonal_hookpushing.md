# Overview

It so happens that arrows set weird values for the direction that a hookpush will take you.  Interestingly, one of these values (`07` from an east arrow) allows you to get significant diagonal movement to the southeast; thus, diagonal hookpushing. Unfortunately, arrows set a fairly small duration value (`09`).

However, it *also* happens that spins do not affect the direction value of the slot they go in, but can set the duration value very high.

These two facts can be combined to execute diagonal hookpushes of meaningful distance, but since both techniques are valuable on their own, I have split them off into separate pages:
