goals: rescue zelda, complete any 5 dungeons of your choice, then complete GT and kill ganon.

potential route:

1. escape as normal s&q eastern
1. eastern get boots and bombs (and rupees? if you're below 10, anyway)
1. s&q sanc DMA, get mirror, cave state PoD through hammer
1. s&q mountain, clip to hera, get small key, go up, get pearl, get hookshot (fake clippers), mirror, herapot, kill moldorm
1. DMD

Now the route diverges; it's not known which of the following is best:

route A (Fox & Sirius first attempt):
  1. go to thieves, get tempered
  1. do skull (entirely nmg)
  1. s&q link's house, run west to fluteless mire and clip into desert
  1. GT, finish

route B (Doomtap theorycraft):
  1. get firerod
  1. thieves, tempered
  1. desert, s&q, run to ice* 
  1. GT, finish

route C (many ppl, theorycraft):
  1. thieves, tempered
  1. desert, s&q
  1. GT, AT, finish

I don't think anyone has put together a whole thieves-less route, but it would be something like:
  1. get tempered (mirror jump is reasonably fast but sucks infinitely; mirror wrap is reasonably fast and I haven't tested it yet, YBA is not as fast and you only get one chance)
  1. do some dungeons. definitely desert, and then... maybe book/bombos/ice + aga tower? unclear.

*or icewrap? you'll have mirrored into desert so you can get back to dw. s&q might be faster than running since you're not already in dw.

bomb route:
saha          +3   3
kiki skip     -1   2
pod floor     -1   1
hammerjump     0   1
beetles       +1   2
h2s           -1   1
TT attic      -1   0
TT basement   -1   -1
fire rod      -1   -2
ice armos     -1   -3

so we should get:
pod left side, 2nd bomb on hj, and 1 bomb in pod lobby (instead of dashing)

arrow route:

eastern: leave w/ 7

tempered get 1:28 -> firerod get 2:51 (with c house lol)
so firerod is ~1:20. sw finish at 5:16 so that's like a 2:30 dungeon if you're already getting firerod.

but firerod first will be a little quicker (since you dont go down to voo and back up) & then you can do thieves after.
