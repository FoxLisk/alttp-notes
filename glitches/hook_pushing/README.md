# Notes on Hookpushing & Stuckpushing

- [A scripted but unedited tutorial on hookpushing & stuckpushing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8UlwL9HYjM) - This covers a bunch of ancilla knowledge as well
   - [The outline of a scripted but unedited hook/stuckpushing tutorial](hook_pushing_tut.md)
- [Mechanics of stuckpushes](stuck_pushing.md)
- [Boomerang hookslot-setting table](boomerang_slot.md)
- [Ancilla duration-setting table](hook_push_durations.md)

I haven't (yet?) written up anything about slot-9-block hookpushing, which is kind of funny. That's the easiest kind! Maybe someday.
