## Mire magic management

After TR, we use a (.5 small magic pots, .5 total) somaria block for the quadrant glitch, a somaria block (.5, 1) for the north somaria, then kill agah2

Then we run to Mire and use Ether (2, 3)

In mire we pick up 2 small pots in fishbone room (2, 1)

then we do the hookpushes. the first one uses 3 lamps (.75, 1.75), 1 fire rod (1, 2.75), and 1 somaria (.5, 3.25). that's a total of 2.25 pots of magic for that hookpush method

the second hookpush can be done the same, bringing us to a total of 5.5 small magic pots. we start with 8, so we can spend up to 2 fire rod shots and still finish the segment!

however that means we end up with 0.5 pots, which is not enough to retry anything.

if we shoot only 1 fire rod shot, we can grab the magic pot in the spike floor room, and then we have enough magic to retry a hook push


Depending on what you kill in TR hub, you might be on the small magic drop from the misc. prize pack, in which case you can try to farm a stalfos. 0 rod shots or refill them with magic pots gets us a retry

there's also the alternative hookpush strat, which uses less magic but is a little trickier to dodge the fireball during. It uses 4 somarias which is 2 small magic pots. so it actually only saves .25 magic pots which is not a relevant amount unless you fuck up lamping or something weird.
