# Getting Started

**Welcome to the A Link to the Past speedrunning community!** Here are some suggestions for how to get started, based on what most people are interested in and find valuable.

## Which Category Do I Start With?

You can start with any category if you already have an idea of what interests you! The most common starting points are:

1. **Any% No Major Glitches (No Save & Quit)**: This is the most popular category by far, with the most active players and the best resources. Your first run of it will likely be around 2 hours long. Resources:

    * [The 1st video of the FMG tutorial series covering basic movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w0iQwS-Tak)
    * [The full FMG tutorial series for advanced players](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtpnQSgr-5pZUZ1Oj9DK4SaTfO5W3hJy) 
1. **Master Sword NMG**: This is a partial category, covering about 1/4th of the full game. It follows the same ruleset as Any% NMG, but with Save & Quit allowed. This is a good way to test the waters and see if running this game is for you. Resources:

1. **Any% Major Glitches ("True Any%")**: This is a very short category, around 3 minutes or less, with several routes available. Resources:

    * [Wiki page covering the 2 fastest routes](https://alttp-wiki.net/index.php/Any%)

## Which Version Should I Play On?

Whichever version you have! All official Nintendo releases of the game are valid, as are modern emulators such as [snes9x](https://github.com/snes9xgit/snes9x/releases). The Japanese 1.0 version is fastest, but anything is fine when you're starting.
