Five arrow strat:

hold v> out of the door, shoot an arrow and swap to v

When you reach the statue, there are two things you might do, depending on the RNG of the right guard.

* If the right guard is walking right or up:
  * shoot right, take a step left, shoot right again, then shoot twice left

* If the right guard is walking down or left:
  * take a step left then shoot right, then another step left, shoot right, then shoot twice left
  * The right guy's spears will block your arrows on down/left RNGs otherwise
  * Alternatively, you can hesitate before shooting right. This makes it easier to not walk too far left, but wastes a few frames of movement. Totally up to personal preference though.
