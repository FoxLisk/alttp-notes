* ancilla fake flippers (3x lamp, 6x arrow 2x bomb dive)
* wait for bombs to explode; don't get hit lol
* go up the stairs (you stay in swim state)
* go down the stairs and hit y/b/a for swim speed right before you hit the staircase
* let go of all directions sometime after you pass the staircase
* tap ^ to get deep in the wall
* hold <v, release v for one frame, then hold <v again; link will stay deep in the wall until he passes the rail and then clip through the rail
