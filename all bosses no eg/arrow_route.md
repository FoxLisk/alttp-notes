N.B.: plan changed (I no longer got pod dropdown by the end of my grind), leaving this as is though for anyone else.

plan for now:

* pod dropdown is probably not optimal ever, but having bombs & arrows early provides insulation so I think i'll get it for now
* Mire hub never, surprisingly. Maybe reasonable if you're at exactly 0 after some serious conveyor trouble. Otherwise it only serves as backup for hookpushes. And if I'm right that doing arrowless hookpush second is just better then...
* TT basement probably always, also surprisingly
* moth pot if <11 ish (check before the north somaria!)
* between TT basement + moth pot it's impossible to have <10 going into Mire if you're paying attention
* You MUST have 6 arrows going into Mire, and 14 is really pretty important
  * it might be better to do arrowless hookpush into vitreous if it will let you kill him with arrows. i dont think it's slower, just more annoying.
  * that means you really only MUST have 3 but honestly banking on getting both hookpushes right seems like a great way to ruin your day
* get the pot in desert torches if you have <3 arrows and 3+ bombs (or 2 if you wanna take a 50/50, which is probably correct)

it seems like it's probably best to leave eastern with a high arrow count and only get pod dropdown if you're under 6 arrows. that'll save 2.5s but add an extra bomb & an extra arrow pot somewhere.

you have to do the hookpushes, because the big key isn't there. so if you mess up, keep using them and slash/spin vitty. you'll probably run out of magic faster than arrows anyway.


\*  there's a lot of stuff you can do here. grab a pot after the spin is like ~90f or so and easy, but if you dont get a drop after you wont be at 30. You can also get 2 pots for only 20-30f more, if you enter the room with <25 (in which case you're 3/4 to get a drop from one of them).

It's really hard to say if this is worth it or not.

you can pull the guys down, shoot the right one twice, drag the left guy down a little more and kill him while walking to the top right pot; this is about as fast as the easy strat, but way harder, but also lets you see if you got a free drop before deciding on how many pots to pick up.

\*\* there are other fine pots after here but this is the fastest one before the last time you'll need arrows
