# Death's Door ™

Death's Door™ is a setup for getting the 0HP state indoors easily. In general you can get 0HP by getting knocked into a door by a hit that will kill you while in link (or superbunny) state. Death's Door™ is a setup to do this with a bomb in a controlled way.

# Why?

Well, the main reason is because it allows you to do a dungeon revival in Swamp Palace: jumping in the water with 0hp will kill you, allowing you to revive as Link.

# How To

First of all make sure you have low enough HP that a bomb will kill you!

These are the requirements:

   1. Stand 13 pixels below the entrance, facing down
   2. Place a bomb
   3. Stand 1 pixel below the entrance, facing up

For step 1, you can just memorize the pixels, or you can do 3 frames of dash + 1 buffer down (for example)

For step 3, if you have boots, you can back up into the door with your sword out, and then buffer down once and dashturn up.
