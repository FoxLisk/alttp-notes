This is intended as a rough outline for a video "tutorial" on Lanmo.

# Goals

Your goal is always to 2 cycle. A 3 cycle is often your fault but not always. A 4 cycle should be assumed to be your fault.

Keep in mind that you can know that the 4 cycle was your fault _and not feel bad about it_. Keeping yourself accountable is good, but beating yourself up for not being the GOAT yet is not productive. You'll get better with time.

# Mechanics

There's a very high mechanical bar to being good at Lanmo. I don't want to focus on it a ton, but here are some things you need to just get good at through practice:

* Bow firing speed
    * Don't mash
        * Yeah I know Eri mashes, but you still shouldn't
    * I learned firing speed by standing next to a wall and firing arrows at various tempos until I got it down
* Timing shots when they appear
    * Lineup should be familiar from where you start the 1st cycle
    * If you stand 1 tile (16px) away from a lanmo and press Y when the 3rd wiggle starts you'll hit every time
* Counting damage
* Avoiding (sometimes invisible) rocks

# Basic stuff

* Where to start the fight
    * Bonk straight up, hold ^> out of the bonk, move ~5px
    * I like to stand higher than a lot of people
* How to do cycle 1
* You generally want to be moving towards the lanmo between shots
    * I don't have a great explanation for why this is good but it was advice that I got and it feels good to me
* You usually want to stand on the inside of the room, for two main reasons
    1. Lanmos are more likely to move across the room
    1. You want any missed arrows to hit the wall ASAP
* Shoot 2 arrows when a Lanmo appears unless you have a strong reason not to
    * Needing to reposition immediately is the main reason not to do this
    * 1 arrow pickup costs about 8 frames. Don't be greedy.
        * If you're 75% sure the Lanmo has 1 arrow left, shoot 2 arrows
        * If you're 90% sure, shoot 2 arrows
        * If you're 99% sure, fine. But you're probably not 99% sure.
* I moderately prefer standing to the left or right of a lanmo over standing above it, and I moderately prefer standing above to standing below

# Advanced stuff

* Starting a cycle
    * As wormsign appears, think about your plan for the whole cycle.
        * First priority is a strong place to stand to get damage in on one worm
        * Second priority is knowing what your next target is
        * Often the timing is such that your targets will be the 1st and 3rd worms to spawn
    * If worms are about to spawn approximately 1 arrow shot apart, shoot 1 arrow in the first worm and then 2 into the second one
    * If 2 worms are spawning diagonal from each other I often stand to make a right angle with them
        * This gives me a good horizontal line up for the one, and if it short hops I'm probably in a good position to get the other

* Target priority
    * Anything you can put damage into
    * If that's more than one worm, spread damage out. A 333 is better than a 411
    * Sometimes it's reasonable to ignore finishing off a worm with 3 arrows in it in order to get 2 or 3 shots on an undamaged worm
        * This scales with your skill level. The better you are at planning your cycles, the less valuable it is to have fewer worms left.

* Changing targets
    * Prioritize shots you can hit.
        * Don't chase!
        * If your target is getting away from you, switch immediately
    * In general, you can always get 1, and often 2, shots in on a spawning worm. Don't assume you can get more.

* Slashing
    * Slashing should only be taken as a "free action," i.e. when you can't do anything useful
    * You should prefer an arrow shot that's 50% to hit over a slash that's 100%
    * You should usually prefer setting up for the next cycle over getting a slash in
    * Obviously, if you're counting and you already got one slash in, the second slash goes up in value a lot
    * Some extremely strong players (for example, wq) seem to prioritize slashing a lot more highly than I do, so take this with a grain of salt
