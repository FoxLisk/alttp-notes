# Statue Drag

This is a way to get to Helmasaur King without traversing basically any of the dungeon.

## Unlock the top middle door

You really gotta do this

## With Mirror

1. Touch the statue in the 2nd room and mirror
    * This puts you in a state where if you hit A you will grab a nonexistent statue. 
        * Note: this overrides picking up bombs
1. Place a bomb high in the door. I do this by walking slightly left before placing the bomb. This gives me several frames where I'm as high as possible while nudging into the door during which I can place the bomb.
1. Walk into the door, face down, grab the statue and drag it up
    * When the bomb hits you, it should snap you to Y-910
    * A visual cue is when Link's hands disappear
1. Face left, place a bomb, slash twice for timing, face down, grab the statue, and pull up again
    * When _this_ bomb hits you, it should snap you to Y-900
    * This is likely to require some minor corrections to your timing to account for exactly how far down you walked. This takes practice.
1. Walk down. if the camera is broken, you've succeeded. If not, mirror and retry.
1. Walk into the big door, face up, drag the statue down. once the pots are fully on screen you can let go of the statue and just walk down.
   * at this point, you're in some weird state but collision is PoD-2, with the centerpiece and the bomb pots.
1. What you wanna do from here is pick up the right pot, walk into the right enclosure, grab the heart from the bottom-right pot, then walk up and hit the switch. 
1. Wiggle up and down until the bottom of the item indicator box is above the top wall.
1. Dash down through the door. This will put you in what LOOKS like the right wing of PoD-1, but is actually still PoD-2; walk down a step, walk right to hit the switch again, dash down again, and you enter helma's room
1. In helma's room, walk left into a spike, then hold <^ to get around the spikes. then walk down and kill the spiky boi.

## Without Mirror

Without the mirror, we have to arm the statue drag state differently.

1. In PoD-2, pull the statue up into the transition
1. Hold A through the transition and back up a step. The range is very forgiving - almost a full tie; approximately Y-2F to Y-22.
1. When the antifairy hits you, start holding ^ to immediately transition
1. Hold `<v` until you are clear of the statue
    * Facing a statue from grabbing distance (1-2px) will disarm statue grab
    * Holding the diagonal is, IMO, the easiest method to avoid disarming statue grab here, but you can do other things, like sword-out movements.
1. At this point, you have to do something to correct the transition - exiting and re-entering PoD is guaranteed to fix it. I'm not sure on the specifics of this, sadly.
1. Once re-entering pod, the rest of the setup is the same.
