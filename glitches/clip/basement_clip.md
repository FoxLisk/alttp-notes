This clip can be thought of in three steps:

1. [Getting Superspeed](#getting-superspeed)
2. [Teleport](#teleport)
3. [Rail clip](#rail-clip)

# Getting Superspeed

## With a potion

1. Get all the way into the spiral staircase, either by having an antifairy hit you or bomb snapping
2. YBA (i.e. press press ^+Y on the same frame. Make sure you are actually missing some of the resource the potion refills.)

## With Somaria

1. Place a slot 0 block (place a block, blow it up, place another while the beams are on screen)
2. Spindash
3. Stand next to the block
4. Lamp a couple times and pick up the block
5. Run into the spiral stairs (you can't go up, but you will get superspeed)

# Teleport

How to read these notes:

    all inputs are 1 frames unless otherwise specified: 

    >2 means "2 frames right" 
    <h means "press left, hold it as long as you want" 
    a^ means "dashturn up" 

`^ >2 v` - if you only move 1 frame right, you can go v and then v> to get all the way in  
`^> v ^> v`  
`v>h` - this will move you deeper in the wall. if it doesnt you need to redo theprevious two `^> v` motions

`<^ < v>` (this is the teleport)

For most of these steps if you miss a diagonal you can just tap v to get back in the wall and only have to retry one of the steps again. I'm not going to list every single retry point out though, sorry.

# Rail Clip

```
<h - first we have to get into the rail with superspeed still active  
a  - then we cancel it  
   <v > av v> (1)  
<h <v > av v> (2)  
<h <v > av v> (3)  
<h <v > av v> (4) - Link should now be on Y-5E  
```
`>`  
slash and hold sword  
`<h` - make sure Link is backed up all the way  
`<v2` - this can be done as a single 2f movement or 2 separate 1f movements  
release sword now  
`a^`  

now place a bomb, hold sword out and move 1f right.
After you get hit, dash left (for as long as you want), cancel with ^ (can hold as long as you want) and then walk < through the rail.
