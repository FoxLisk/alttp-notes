Flowchart:

1. If the first rat walks <, hold <^ to the left wall
2. If the second rat walks <, hold <^ past the left wall and then nudge back into position
3. Otherwise, hold ^.

In any case, this room has a lot of RNG to deal with that is out of scope for this video.

After you start pushing block, hold <^ during the push to slide around the block.
When on the left of the block, switch to ^> to align with the stairs.
