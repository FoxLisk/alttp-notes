This is mostly a "Just Do The Inputs" room. [Watch Dom do it](https://api.strats.alttp.run/media/roomtimes/DomTurchi_junction-2.mp4) and try to copy him.

General path here:

Hold ^ and start a dash. Timing dashes in rooms where the first thing you do is dash is pretty important.

Cancel dash < about 1 big-tile [TODO: tile definitions] above the horizontal wall. 

There are 3 big protrusions (columns?) in the wall, with 2 big-tiles of regular wall between them. When you're approximately 1 big-tile away from the rightmost protrustion, place a bomb. Start walking <^ until you clear the rail, then throw the bomb up when your feet are just barely past the bottom of the horizontal rail.

The goal is to stand fully inside of the bombable floor when it opens, so you fall immediately. If you're high, you'll slip before you fall. If you're low, or your bomb is high, you'll take damage.
