1. if you dash through an enemy, there is a "lockout period" after canceling your dash during which you can't slash (as is well known)
2. if you pitdash through an enemy, link keeps his sword held out when you cancel your dash, which prevents dashturning (this is why the inputs on your way to sw mummy room are weird)
2a. in places that aren't that one dash in skull woods, you can cancel your dash with a cardinal, so this ends up not really mattering in most places
3. if you dash through an enemy into a screen transition, link gains the sword-held-out part of the lockout for whatever reason, preventing dash turning
and finally
4. if you dash through an enemy, and then re-dash within the lockout period, the lockout period applies to the new dash. You can chain this through more dashes if you want.

This is why you can't dashturn on the lake screen on the way to agah tower if you kill the guard.
