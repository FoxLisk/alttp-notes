This is the superjump DMD to mire

This trick is done in the dark world with a wrapped screen. It will make more sense if you [watch a clip of it](https://clips.twitch.tv/TransparentCoyTurnipM4xHeh-X5YkLIerOWIXJhkR).

1. run to the bottom left of the mountain. at the last `\_` curve, hookspeed/spindash and clip through the intersection.
1. hold <^ to line up high, walk < til you can't anymore, then wiggle <v until link is ~1 body width from the side of the screen (x ~= 614)
1. walk down, quickhop. you get a huge multi-screen fall
1. walk down & quickhop again
1. transition left
1. walk <^ to get a dash lane and dash through the transition (don't hop down!)
1. dash left, qh up when you get a chance, dash left again
1. dash ^ when you're to the left of the 2x2 swamp lotus
   1. this will wrap you north twice. immediately after the second wrap, cancel dash
1. walk > until you're at the _ part of the \_
   1. this also lines you up sort of halfway into the vertical row of small flowers in the swamp
1. dash up until the thing that would bonk you. this is the thing inside the platform with the ether tablet
1. walk around it and ether
   1. if you use ether while walking down you get the infamous "Chex Slide," and also potentially save a dozen or so frames
1. enjoy fabulous lightning bolt
