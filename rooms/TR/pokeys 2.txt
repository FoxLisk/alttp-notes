summary/flowchart:
  if left pokey is going ul:
    head towards the left pot
    if right pokey is also going ul, wait about 1 tile from the pot and double spin
    otherwise spin when you get lined up with the pot and then go hunt the other one down
  if right pokey is going ur:
    head towards the right pot
    if left pokey is also going ur, wait about 1 tile from the pot and double spin
    otherwise spin when you get lined up with the pot and then go hunt the other one down
  


keydash: dash in, cancel left, dash up
slow walk: wait for the roller to finish going < and then walk behind it
fast walk: walk above the roller and around it while it's going <


dl dl (keydash)
  - optimal:
    * walk <v til you're about 1.5 tiles away from the wall lined up with the shooter.
    * walk a step v and a step <v, release spin. you want the pokey to be kinda jumping into you; this spin is done fairly high up
    * walk a step ^ and start a second spin. take a step v and spin when the pokey is bouncing off the wall. sometimes this is more of a <v depending on exact movement up to that point
    * walk above the shooter and dash >

dl dr (keydash)
  - optimal:
    * walk <v until you're 1 tile away from the wall
    * walk v until a few pixels below the top of the pot, spin the first pokey
    * walk ^ ~1/2 tile, slash
    * walk > until lined up with bottom door
    * walk ^> until lined up with shooter
    * walk ^ and then ^> into the pokey, release spin. you'll be approx 1 tile right of the shooter lined up in the middle of a tile
    * walk v and dash out

dl ul (slow walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk <v for about a tile
    * walk < until aligned with the pot, spin the pokey
    * slash <, walk down, spin the second pokey
    * dash > and walk out

dl ur (slow walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk v until ~1.5 tiles above top of shooter. spin pokey
    * walk <, slash, keep walking < until about 1 tile left of shooter
    * walk v, then <v into the pokey and spin
    * dash > and walk out

dr dl (slow walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk down to the shooter. bait the fireball[1] and then line up so link is sort of centered on the right side of the shooter. double spin both pokeys
    * walk > and v to line up with the door and dash out
    * you dont have to be *that* fast getting out b/c it's a slow walk cycle anyway

dr dr (slow walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk v> until about 1/2 tile to the left of the pots (1.5 tiles from the right wall).
    * walk v a little more (slightly below the medusa) and spin the pokey.
      * it's very easy to accidentally poke spin instead of double spinning; you can release from kinda far away from the pokey
    * walk ^ and slash
    * walk > almost to the door, hesitate slightly, walk down and release spin. you want to be a lttle above the door when you spin to bait the fireball
    * walk v, hestitate slightly, and dash out.

dr ul (slow walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk <v about 1/2 to 1 tile, then walk < to the pot. release spin
    * slash down, then walk > and v> til you're face mashing the shooter and link's middle is lined up with the right side of the shooter. release spin
    * dash out. or just walk, the roller room is on a terrible cycle so the dash here doesn't seem to save time

dr ur (fast walk/bonk)
  - optimal:
    * walk v and spin the first pokey
    * slash v and then walk v>
      * slash ^ is also fine and makes it easier not to poke, but feels kinda wonky
    * wait when you're ~1 tile ^> of the shooter to bait the fireball. then v> release spin and dash out

ul dl (slow walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk v and spin
    * slash <
    * walk < until about 1 tile left of the shooter
    * hesitate slightly, then walk v and spin the second pokey
    * walk ^ and dash >
    * you can be pretty sloppy on this one b/c the roller cycle sucks

ul dr (fast walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk v and spin
    * slash >
    * walk v> until lined up with the door
    * walk v and spin the pokey

ul ul (fast walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk < until about 1 tile away from the right side of the pot
      * you wanna stay pretty high up
    * double spin them
    * walk > to dodge fireball
    * v> to the side of the shooter and dash out.

ul ur (keydash)
  - optimal:
    * walk v
    * double spin
    * walk v> to the side of the shooter and dash out

ur dl (slow walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk > til ~1 tile from left of pot
    * walk v> and release spin
    * slash <, walk < until lined up with the left of the shooter
    * walk v and spin the second pokey
    * dash > and walk out

ur dr (fast walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk > til ~1 tile from left of pot
    * walk v> and release spin
    * slash >
    * walk v and spin second pokey
    * dash out
    * this one is pretty tight to make the fast walk cycle

ur ul (slow walk)
  - optimal:
    * walk < til ~1 tile from right of pot
    * walk <v and release spin
    * slash v
    * walk > to dodge fireball, then v>
    * spin when you're a little ^> of the shooter
    * dash out

ur ur (bonk)
  - optimal:
    * walk > until a little less than 1 tile from left of pot
    * double spin when they get to you
    * walk v and dash out

[1] when pokeys are bouncing "out" (i.e. the right one is going v> or ^>), they will bounce twice, then hit the wall and bounce off it a little on their third bounce. the start of the 4th bounce, which is the first one they do on their way back into the room after hitting the wall, is the time to bait the fireball.
