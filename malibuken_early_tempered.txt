* down port off of the 3rd hump in the bottom left part of VoO
* transition down
* mirror wrap up
* walk up a little bit (you can't see link but it's a gigantic window)
  * if you walk up too high, you get a hop upwards. you want a hop downwards from the bottom of the screen around to the top. idk how to fix the up hop if it's possible.
* dash right. your camera is now fixed more or less; you're genuinely interacting with the stuff on screen momentarily
* go over beneath the red tree to your right and line up with the right side of the screen (you can't go too far; there's a wall)
* walk up until the wall stops you
* go right until you're between the sign and the wall
* mirror
* walk left; you'll scroll the screen
* walk v and < until link is past the trees, the dash right
* stop around the 2nd column of bushes (you can't go too far, you'll bonk and be fine)
* walk v and you'll have to go <v and v> a little. eventually you can slash a few bushes out of your way going > and v. then you turn < and slash a bush that's about lined up with the race guy's head, then dash south lined up with him (you can dash too far, be careful), then walk > and ^ into the house
* leave it, correct camera, go to your portal (is bonking the wall faster? idk). pick up the bush, line up on a good pixel, and throw the bush
    * good px: A6F (v/^) A6E (^, v kills)) A70 (no correction needed; ^ is safe, v is safe); A71 (^/v safe, unnecessary) A72 (^/v safe, unnecessary), A74 is safe. basically A70-A75 are good, and A6F/A6E you can tap up to be safe.
    * short version: get on y pixel A6E-A75, throw bush, tap up, then right, slash the bush and get your man.
    * free setup: dash up and nudge the library wall
    * if you mirror bonk just line up and try again

seems to be about a minute slower than doing it with mitts. almost certainly optimal in 1-2 dungeons, maybe 3 or 4 as well.
