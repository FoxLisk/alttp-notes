If you are touching a statue you can grab and pull it
If you are 1 pixel away from it while facing right or down, you will also grab and pull it

If you are 1 pixel away from it while facing up or left, or 2 pixels away while facing right or down, you will enter the "grabbing a statue" animation but not be able to pull it

All of these positions (where pressing A would put you in a grabbing animation) are sufficient to arm statue drag.
